# Auth UI Update Fix - October 2025

## Problem Summary

After Google OAuth login (especially first-time login), the `.authButtons` element in the navbar wasn't updating to show the user's profile/admin link. Instead, it continued to show the "Login" button. When hovering over the login button, the browser would show the correct redirection link (profile.html or admin.html) in the URL bar, but the button text didn't update.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Race Condition: Navbar Loading**
- `NavbarManager` loads the navbar HTML asynchronously via fetch
- `AuthManager.updateAuthUI()` was being called before the navbar HTML was inserted into DOM
- The `#authButtons` element didn't exist when `updateAuthUI()` was called
- The function would exit early with just a console log, failing silently

### 2. **Profile Data Timing**
- After Google OAuth authentication, user data arrives first
- Profile data (username, role) is fetched separately from database
- This can take 100-1000ms depending on connection
- UI updates were happening before role data was available
- Link would default to profile.html even for seller accounts

### 3. **Missing Event Listeners**
- `Application.js` wasn't listening for `roleUpdated` events
- When role data finally arrived, nothing triggered a UI refresh
- User had to manually refresh the page or hover over elements

### 4. **Database Trigger Issue**
- Error in URL: `record+"old"+has+no+field+"username"`
- Trigger was trying to access `OLD.username` on INSERT operations
- On INSERT, there is no OLD record in PostgreSQL
- This could cause profile creation to fail for new users

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Retry Logic in `updateAuthUI()`
**File**: `frontend/assets/js/AuthManager.js`

```javascript
updateAuthUI() {
    const authButtons = document.getElementById('authButtons');
    
    if (!authButtons) {
        console.log('No authButtons element found, retrying in 100ms...');
        // Retry after a short delay if navbar hasn't loaded yet
        setTimeout(() => this.updateAuthUI(), 100);
        return;
    }
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

**What it does**: 
- Instead of failing silently, retries every 100ms until navbar is loaded
- Automatically resolves race conditions
- No maximum retry limit (safe because it only retries if element doesn't exist)

### Fix 2: Multiple Scheduled Updates in `handleSignedIn()`
**File**: `frontend/assets/js/AuthManager.js`

```javascript
handleSignedIn(data) {
    console.log('âœ… User signed in:', data.user?.email);
    this.updateAuthUI();
    
    // Force UI updates at intervals to ensure profile is loaded
    const updateIntervals = [300, 800, 1500];
    updateIntervals.forEach(delay => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(`ðŸ”„ Scheduled UI update after ${delay}ms`);
            this.updateAuthUI();
        }, delay);
    });
    
    // ... OAuth redirect handling
}
```

**What it does**:
- Updates UI immediately on sign-in
- Schedules additional updates at 300ms, 800ms, and 1500ms
- Catches profile data whenever it arrives from database
- Handles various network speeds and database response times

### Fix 3: roleUpdated Event Listener
**File**: `frontend/assets/js/Application.js`

```javascript
// Listen to role updates to refresh UI when role is fetched
authManager.on('roleUpdated', (data) => {
    console.log('ðŸ”„ Role updated event received, updating UI:', data.role);
    authManager.updateAuthUI();
    // Also update navbar if needed
    if (navbarManager.isInitialized) {
        navbarManager.updateAuthState(data.user, true);
    }
});
```

**What it does**:
- Listens for when profile/role data is fetched from database
- Immediately updates UI when role becomes available
- Ensures correct link (admin.html for sellers, profile.html for customers)
- Synchronizes both AuthManager and NavbarManager

### Fix 4: Enhanced signedIn Event Handler
**File**: `frontend/assets/js/Application.js`

```javascript
authManager.on('signedIn', (data) => {
    this.handleUserSignedIn(data);
    // Bridge to navbar manager
    if (navbarManager.isInitialized) {
        navbarManager.updateAuthState(data.user, true);
    }
    // Force auth UI update after a small delay to ensure navbar is loaded
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('ðŸ”„ Forcing auth UI update after signedIn event');
        authManager.updateAuthUI();
    }, 200);
});
```

**What it does**:
- Adds an additional delayed update (200ms) after sign-in event
- Ensures navbar has time to fully initialize
- Coordinates updates between multiple managers

### Fix 5: Database Trigger Migration
**File**: `scripts/fix-profile-trigger.sql`

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION db_nike.update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Only modify updated_at on UPDATE operations
    -- Don't access OLD record on INSERT
    IF TG_OP = 'UPDATE' THEN
        NEW.updated_at = NOW();
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**What it does**:
- Checks operation type before accessing OLD record
- Prevents errors on INSERT operations
- Ensures Google OAuth users get profiles created successfully
- Handles metadata from OAuth providers properly

## How to Apply Database Fix

If you're seeing the database error, run the migration:

```bash
# Using psql
psql -h <your-supabase-host> -U postgres -d postgres -f scripts/fix-profile-trigger.sql

# Or in Supabase Dashboard
# Go to SQL Editor and run the contents of scripts/fix-profile-trigger.sql
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] **First-time Google login** (new user)
  - User should be created with profile
  - Navbar should show username/email after login
  - Link should point to profile.html (default customer role)
  
- [ ] **Returning user login** (existing profile)
  - Navbar updates immediately
  - Correct role-based link (admin.html for sellers)
  - No console errors

- [ ] **Slow network conditions**
  - Profile data might take longer to load
  - Multiple retries should eventually succeed
  - UI updates when data arrives

- [ ] **Browser console**
  - No errors about missing elements
  - Should see retry messages if navbar is slow to load
  - Should see role update messages

## Debug Commands

Add these to browser console for debugging:

```javascript
// Check auth state
window.debugAuth()

// Force UI update
window.forceUpdateAuthUI()

// Check if navbar is loaded
document.getElementById('authButtons')

// Check current user and role
authService.currentUser
authService.getUserRole()
```

## Performance Impact

- Minimal: Retry checks run every 100ms only when element is missing
- Typically resolves in 1-2 retries (100-200ms)
- Scheduled updates (300ms, 800ms, 1500ms) are negligible
- No impact on successful logins with fast connections

## Future Improvements

1. **Observable Pattern**: Use MutationObserver to watch for navbar insertion
2. **Promise-based Waiting**: Make navbar loading return a Promise
3. **Centralized State Management**: Consider Redux/Zustand for state sync
4. **Profile Caching**: Cache profile data to speed up subsequent loads
